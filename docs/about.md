# About BuildBee 

BuildBee is a simple and powerful way to 3D print from your desktop or share your printer with your class or office. 

Get started using the [BuildBee Desktop](https://buildbee.com/landing/desktop) app, or ditch the desktop and make your own [BuildBee CloudDock](https://buildbee.com/landing/setup) and completely print from the web.
