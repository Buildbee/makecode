# BuildBee Style Guide

## Writing steps
* Tell the user what they're making
* Tell them the instructions
* Tell them what will happen, and why.

## Writing steps
* Only give a max of 2 instructions at a time.
* Every step should have a icon, if possible.  
* Whenever talking about numbers, wrap in two astersisks.  This is a BuildBee special hack to make text look like reporter blocks 
```
**12** 
```

## The last step
The last step should be a call to action of what they should do next. Add glitter!  But also how to print their projects.

## Adding icons for each step
My process for this is to copy an icon from another project, then paste screen grabs in it and "save as" for each step from my image editor. You can zoom the simulator in and out to do the sizing.

The icon files have a #left-icon added to the end of the path. This lets us do CSS styling to shrink and place the icon.

## Here's what language to avoid
* Only introduce math terms when they are needed.  Use physical terms like "ground" where ever possible.
* Long sentences.  Some kids have great difficulty reading and following instructions and long paragraphs of text can lead to frustration. 
* Reading difficulty is partially based on the number of syllables in a word, so prefer shorter words.


## Here's what to do
* Encourage directions for exploration. 
* Congratulate for success, but dont go over the top.  Some kids skip ahead and then see the effusion of unearned congrats means less.
* Keep the number of steps short - use templates if you need to just focus on one concept.
