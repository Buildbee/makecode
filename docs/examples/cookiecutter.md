# Cookie Cutters
Learn how to add and subtract shapes to make a cookie cutter.

![Make a cookie cutter](/docs/static/examples/subtractshapes/project-image.png)

```template
operators.placeOnGround(function () {
    shapes.polygon3D(6, 10, 10)
})
```

## Step 1 @fullscreen
Todays challenge is to turn this hexagon into a cookie cutter. 

In order to do this we need to use a new block, ``||Operators:subtractShapes||``.  

When we subtract shapes - we can cut holes, which leads to more interesting designs. (Click next to continue.)


## Step 2 @fullscreen
![hexagon](/docs/static/examples/cookiecutter/hexagon.png#left-icon)

Subtracting a shape (part 1 of 2)

Add a subtract shapes ``||Operators:subtractShapes||`` block around the ``||Shapes:polygon||`` block.  This will help us cut out the middle of the hexagon.

```blocks
operators.placeOnGround(function () {
    //@highlight
    operators.subtractShapes(function () {
        shapes.polygon3D(6, 10, 10)
    })
})
```

## Step 3 @fullscreen
![hexagon cutout](/docs/static/examples/cookiecutter/hexagon-cutout.png#left-icon)

Subtracting a shape (part 2 of 2)

Place a second ``||Shapes:polygon||`` block in the ``||Operators:subtractShapes||`` block.  Change the radius to **8**.

Tip!  If your object just disappeared - you haven't set the radius yet! ðŸ™ƒ 


```blocks
operators.placeOnGround(function () {
    operators.subtractShapes(function () {
        shapes.polygon3D(6, 10, 10)
        //@highlight
        shapes.polygon3D(6, 8, 10)
    })

})



```

## Step 4
![style edges](/docs/static/examples/cookiecutter/hexagon-styleedges.png#left-icon)

Add some style!  Place a second ``||Operators:styleEdges||`` block around the  ``||Operators:subtractShapes||`` block.  

Play with the edge style, to 'chamfer' or 'fillet' the top of the cookie cutter - this makes the edge easier to hold in your hand.  

Adjust the radius to **0.2** mm, or whatever you think looks great!

```blocks
operators.placeOnGround(function () {
    //@highlight
    operators.styleEdges(EdgeStyle.ConcaveFillet, StyleEdgeDirection.Top, 0.2, function () {
        operators.subtractShapes(function () {
            shapes.polygon3D(6, 10, 10)
            shapes.polygon3D(6, 8, 10)
        })
    })
})
```

## Step 5 @unplugged

Now that you know how to cut out basic shapes - you can build your own by mixing and matching shapes!
