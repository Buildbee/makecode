### Adding Color to Projects
Make your 3D printing projects look great with the use of color!


### A note about color in 3D Printing
![Add Shapes](/docs/reference/colors/redfilament.jpg?v=DOCVER-2) 

Often times, in 3D printing the actual color of the final print is determined by the type of filament you use.  If your printer has red filament loaded, your object will come out red!  

Because the files save to STL, only the shapes are saved - not the color information.  

There are ways to add color to your final print
* Paint your final object using acrylic model paints
* Use a rainbow colored filament (example)[https://buildbee.com/shop#filament-special]
* Pause the printer at a certain point and reload your printer with a different color
* Use specialized equipment, such as a dual extruder
