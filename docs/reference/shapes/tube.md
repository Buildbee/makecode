```sig

```

The tube is a cylindrical shape with the interior cut out.  Optionally, by turning down the number of sides you can make other shapes, like hexagonal tubes, etc.


**Options:**
* **Thickness** - The thickness of the walls of the tube
* **Radius** - How far from the center to the edge of the tube
* **Height** - how high to make the tube

**Advanced Options:** - click (+) to expand
* **Sides** - how many sides to use to make the tube.  Adding more sides makes it more circular, using less sides makes it more like a regular polygon (triangle, cube, pentagon, hex, etc).
* **Color** - set the color of the cube.
